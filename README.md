This should install CentOS 7.1 on a new virtualbox environment, install Apache and php on that vbox sync your local codebase to the vbox environment and configure apache and php.
Once finished you should be able to open a browser and hit either http://glms:8080, http://clms:8080 or http://gams:8080

NOTE: at some point I anticipate forwarding port 80 from the host to the guest machine, when that time comes you'll no longer need to specify a port in the browser. I will update this document when that time comes.

If you run into any apache or php config issue please let me know so i can update the fix to the chef cookbooks in order to keep this process completly automated.
